The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here
I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame
The action is tame
Explicitly dull
Arousal annulled
Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day
With nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations
All misinformation
My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band
They sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black
The music is crap
In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun,
but just another one

of using up a day
